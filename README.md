# Pike13Buttons
Tampermonkey script that adds useful buttons to the Pike13 calendar.

I wrote this earlier this year and have since moved on from my job that used Pike13. As such, I don't have access to a page where I  can test the script so it may very well be out of date. Hopefully any changes will be small, css selectors etc.
